Blackjack Solitaire is a one-player game with scoring rules inspired by the casino game of Blackjack, where players attempt to build a hand with a value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding 21.

Playing the Game:
In this game, playing cards are played onto a grid with four rows and five columns. Cards are drawn one at a time from a standard deck of 52, and the player must choose a location for each card before proceeding. Once a card has been placed on the grid, the card cannot be moved. There are four special discard spots that allow cards placed there to be ignored–they will not contribute to the final scoring. This leaves 16 spaces for cards to be placed where they will be counted in the final score.

Once all 16 scored spaces in the grid have been filled with a card, a score is calculated. Each of the four rows and five columns in the grid count as an individual hand and will be scored as such.

Scoring the Game:
Each card has a value. Cards with numbers on them (2s through 10s) have value equal to the number on the card. “Face” cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) are valued at 10 each. Aces can be “high”, counting as value 11, or “low”, counting as value 1, depending on which value would give the player a higher score without exceeding 21. Hands are calculated by summing the values of the cards in them. Each hand, then, has a cumulative value.
